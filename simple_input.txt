the world is a beautiful place filled with wonders and marvels. it has oceans that stretch far and wide mountains that rise above the clouds and deserts that tell stories of time the the beauty of the natural world cannot be overstated. children plays in the fields while the sun set beyond horizon birds chirping melodies that echo in heart of those who listens the dog chased the the cat across the yard it barked loudly it was a chaotic scene but amusing to watch from the the window. they they did not know the fence was open the dog kept running while the cat darted into bushes.
silence return as the scene fade a man with a telescope is watching sky he is is looking for stars planets or maybe aliens he forgot to wear the coat it was cold night sky was clear but the wind bite his skin. he said he saw the the spaceship fly across the the moon. nobody believe him but he keep telling the story many students struggle with the assignments because they wait until last moment they do not plan ahead and they they end up submitting rushed work teacher try to help but without effort from students it is hard. time management is the key to success.
